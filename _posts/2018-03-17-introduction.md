### Welcome
Tech Debt is a blog that details my ongoing adventures through the Software Development Lifecycle. Here you can find my personal stories, lessons, projects, and much, much more. Thank you so much for spending your personal time to dive into my thoughts and I please feel free to reach out!

### Blog Objectives
I want to structure each Tech Debt post to be like a sprint story. In general I also want the blog to be a place where I can also store all my solutions to the problems that I find at work.

Here are the values that I want Tech Debt to give to provide:
* I want to learn how to write proficiently and eloquently
* I want a place where I can store my solutions to problems
* I want to learn how to manage a blog
* I need something to do on the weekends :^)

### Why a Blog?

In my day job, I've noticed that I have a very hard time articulating and organizing my thoughts in a written format. Even writing this intro has taken me 3 hours to figure out what to write about.

Below is where I encounter some form of writing at work:
* sprint stories
* code documentation targeted toward engineers
* high level software guides for non-engineering departments
* design and decision docs
* emails
* meeting agendas
* conference presentations
* quarterly performance evaluations

### Super Simple About Me
* Worked in cyber security since mid 2016, mostly as a software engineer
* B.S. in Computer Science, 2016
* Spent 3 years at a community collect, 3 years at a "4 year" university
* I love writing scripts in python
* API design makes me happy
