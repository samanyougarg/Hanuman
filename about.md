Hi there!

This is MarcelIe. I’m a Brazilian Production Engineer living in Canada since 2017. During my Bachelor Degree I was introduced to Statistics and Management, and ever since I adopted the philosophy of never guessing, trying to play with numbers to drive decision making. I’m currently a Master of Data Science Candidate at UBC, working on levelling up my programming skills.
